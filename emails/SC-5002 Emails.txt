Subject: General guidelines
---------------------------
Some resources in this scenario might take several minutes to deploy. Please review the other tasks in the lab while the deployment completes. You may perform other tasks that do not rely on that deployment.

Thank you for agreeing to help our team secure Azure services and workloads with Microsoft Defender for Cloud regulatory compliance controls.

We have some general guidelines you need to follow when you perform tasks in Azure:

• When creating objects, use the default settings unless a different configuration is required to complete the task successfully.
• Only create, delete, or modify objects to achieve the stated requirements. Unnecessary changes to the environment may adversely affect your final score.
• If there are multiple approaches to achieving a goal, always choose the approach the requires the least amount of administrative effort.
• A check box is provided in the header of each email so you can mark the tasks included in that email as complete. The check box is provided for your convenience; you are not required to select it. It is not used for scoring.

Thanks,
Chief Technology Officer (CTO)



Subject: Existing environment

Password:

You can also find the sign in information in the Instructions tab.

You have been given rights to the RG1 resource group. Please create all Azure objects in this resource group.

Subject: Important information!!!
---------------------------------
Since you are using a new Azure subscription, it may take a long time for Microsoft Defender for Cloud to complete the initial scan that you will configure. You will be evaluated on the completion of the
configuration tasks, NOT on successful completion of the scans. Do NOT wait for the scans to complete before proceeding to another task or before finishing the assessment.

If you recieve an error message when you attempt to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud in the subscription, please try again.

This environment is NOT configured to enable a 100% secure score. You do NOT need to remediate all recommendations to successfully complete the experience.

When you upgrade Microsoft Defender for Cloud you may receive an error message that states Error starting Microsoft Defender trial. This error message can be ignored.

Thanks,
Chief Technology Officer (CTO)




Subject: Protecting VM1
-----------------------
Hello,

We want to better control administrative access to our virtual machines. Specifically, we want to minimize the attack surfaces related to management access.

This is your task:

You need to ensure that users must request access before establishing an RDP connection to VM1. The access must only be allowed for one hour before requiring that another request be made.

Thanks,
Security Administrator





Subject: Configure Logging
--------------------------
Hello,

We want to use Microsoft Defender for Cloud to collect registry settings and monitor security misconfiguration in the Windows operating system on our Azure virtual machines.

This is your task:

You need to ensure that Defender for Cloud can use File Integrity Monitoring to collect Windows registry settings for the Azure virtual machines. Windows and Linux files should NOT be collected at this time.
Next, you need to ensure that the Guest Configuration Agent is deployed to all Azure virtual machines.

Thanks,
Security Administrator
